        <p class="leading-relaxed font-semibold text-gray-800">Some types of buy to let mortgages are not regulated by the FCA. Think carefully before securing other debts against your home. As a mortgage is secured against your home, it may be repossessed if you do not keep up with repayments on your mortgage.
            Equity released from your home will also be secured against it.</p>
